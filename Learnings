WebDriver IO only provides assertions related to the browser or UI controls to get
additional assertions, we need chai package.Which can be installed using 'npm install chai'

WebDriverIO confuses the chai expect with its own expect. To prevent this, import the chai 
package at the beginning of the file.
  const expectChai=require('chai').expect
  expectChai(await dropDown.getValue()).toBe.equal("stud")

Node js is the base js engine where webDriverIO tests will run.Node.js provides a 
runtime environment outside of the browser. It's also built on the Chrome V8 
JavaScript engine. This makes it possible to build back-end applications using the 
same JavaScript programming language you may be familiar with.
