WebDriver IO only provides assertions related to the browser or UI controls to get
additional assertions, we need chai package.Which can be installed using 'npm install chai'

WebDriverIO confuses the chai expect with its own expect. To prevent this, import the chai 
package at the beginning of the file.
  const expectChai=require('chai').expect
  expectChai(await dropDown.getValue()).toBe.equal("stud")
